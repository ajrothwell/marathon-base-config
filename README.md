# mapboard-base-config

This repo stores org-level configuration for City of Philadelphia Mapboard applications. This is primarily for convenience, so individual apps don't have to define shared assets such as basemaps, geocoding APIs, etc.

## Development

**Important**: When working on `mapboard-base-config`, make sure you're on a branch with the same name as the `mapboard` branch you're working on. For example, if you're working on `cool-new-feature`, make sure you `cd ../mapboard-base-config && git checkout -b cool-new-feature` before starting work.
